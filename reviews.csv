4.0;Former Employee, less than 1 year;It's really up to you whether it's your heaven or your hell;Jul 27, 2018 - Anonymous Employee;"- the product is exciting and amazing, the company's success has been overwhelming so far;- steep learning curve and mostly knowledgeable, talented and work-driven coworkers. In dev, QA & design positions you have to either be your best self or catch up pretty fast, otherwise there's a chance you'd be fired;- this company looks pretty good on resume, plenty of startups and beyond will want you due to Revolut's fame of hard-working culture;- great freedom in expressing yourself, choice of technology and ability to make a direct impact on the product;- I really believe that the higher management cares about the product a lot, it's just they have such strong opinions on some of the processes that they're having a hard time finding a balance between being successful enterpreneurs / strong leaders and employers who care about and listen to their people. Also, not everyone agrees with them, but at least they are being brutally honest with other people instead of tiptoeing around - this is a skill I personally admire;- if you're interested not only in your field of expertise, but in other parts of the product and the bigger structure, you will be encouraged to explore and contribute;- great London accommodation, and with the new office it's even better!";"- yes, work-life balance is not good, but hardly anyone makes you work overtime. If you're really good at what you do and achieve tangible results, you can work usual hours. The other deal is that it takes a really strong, self-confident person immune to peer pressure to do that. I feel like overtime is appropriate at a company like that, but some people may burn out without realizing it;- Revolut's moral compass is certainly off. I've seen very talented people who were told they are worthless and ""can't make anything good"" just to trigger them to outdo themselves. The culture of being arrogant and supersmart is cultivated so heavily here that the majority seems to have forgotten that only a combination of people with very different skills (some visionaries, some hard-workers, some detail-oriented and some just very loyal) can create a good and complete project;- teamwork is not particularly encouraged, instead people are seen as self-sufficient units. For some of them, it works amazing, because they truly are. But some people here still require mentoring, discipline and a helping hand most of all, and can jeopardize the outcome of projects;- with being a startup, especially at this pace, comes lack of structure and chaos. Here, I think, having so many strong personalities on the team bites the management in the back. The lack of structure is not for the lack of trying, it's because a lot of people here believe it's their opinion that is right and refuse to compromise. Any agreements or possible solutions are criticized and ridiculed (externally or internally), and the chaos endures.";133

Mistakes are not acceptable and shamed, at times publicly. I was in a virtual meeting where a colleague was called ""stupid"" by an executive. The best way to be successful at this company is to just do what you're told. The executives are very much feared and held in low regard.-Poor culture, there just isn't anything that people are happy to brag about here-Founders and global exec teams are too in the weeds. They require to be a part of every decision making process. This means there's a lack of trust and accountability to the said ""brilliant"" people who were hired.

1.0;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Avoid at all costs.;Jan 19, 2021 - Anonymous Employee;You learn a lot, but your opinion won’t be valued.;Literally everything. Supervisors have no idea what they’re doing, and the CEO encourages micromanaging. They claim to encourage innovation, but if you disagree with the CEOs ideas you’ll most likely be fired. I’ve never seen so much turnover in one company in my life. The misogyny is strong here as well. Higher up employees frequently act inappropriately and there is no repercussion.  I am pretty sure the positive reviews are all from executive management.;43

2.0;Former Employee, more than 1 year;A culture that encourages brown-nosing Line and Functional Managers;May 13, 2022 - Anonymous Employee;1. Globally recognised brand, leader in the neobank space2. Great benefits, especially when it comes to leave days 3. Flexible work arrangements;"1. If you offend your line/functional managers, you could suffer and receive an unfair grading during the quarterly performance review. This is made worse as there is no appeal process for you to defend your work. Since only line managers' and functional managers' gradings matter, this only encourages everyone to play nice and be ""supportive"" of their managers' every decision or pander to their egos. 2. Lack of autonomy at country-level means everything from budgets to hiring are dependent upon the graces of the global teams. Country CEOs are powerless and this in turn makes them afraid to speak up against decisions that don't make sense. 3. No accountability when it comes to certain individuals in the organisation, especially those close to the senior management. Everyone's KPIs and performances are monitored closely - to the point of micro-managing people's work and strategies. But nothing is said about their inability to meet their KPIs. 4. Focus on quarterly KPIs means that a lot of people - even the most brilliant ones - develop tunnel vision after spending some time at Revolut. So focused on quarterly KPIs that any plans or ideas that require longer time to yield results will be shot down.";6

5.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;Great Company to Work With - Progressive;May 11, 2022 - Business Control Officer;The best thing i like about working at Revolut is it is a very progressive minded company and there is flexibility to design your hours, your day and vacations and work all on your own. That gives you the confidence that there is trust.The other thing I love is that the people are very accessible and eager to help and that you are encouraged to bring ideas to the table to make the processes better which is great as you feel like you can really add value. Very excited to grow with the Firm in this new age.What I also love is the global mobility and exposure opportunities that it offers.;Like any other Startup, it is very dynamic and processes are still not set in stone and you have to be very fast paced to learn and enhance processes - this actually is a great learning opportunity.;1

In Revolut I feel safe, I feel like I belong to this big family! Thank you!;While working in a big FinTech company, you'll have many responsibilities, but this applies to everything, so, if you are looking an easy job with no responsibilities, then, this is not for you. Here at Revolut, you need to be mature enough to understand all good principles and handle with any kind of situation. I would not consider this part of review as a Cons but as an advice. :);1

5.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;A lot of responsibility and autonomy for a PO;Apr 13, 2022 - Product Manager;Want I find great about being a PO at Revolut is how much the company trusts the PO to be autonomous. Very often PO becomes a glorified projected manager, trying to juggle competing initiatives from many stakeholders without any means to drive growth. That's not the case for Revolut. A PO can make decisions on their own and act very independently. I heard rumours about toxic culture and crazy hours, but have not encountered this at all, at least no more than at any other place I've worked at (I don't think any motivated and driven PO expects a 9 to 5 job without any extra hours at all).;You will probably end up doing more QA work than at other companies, as full responsibility for the product will also mean;0
5.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;A rocketship with incredibly talented, motivated and mission-driven people;Mar 7, 2022 - Senior Product Manager;I'm a Senior Product Manager in the Fincrime team working on building tools, processes and product to ensure compliance, minimise business risk and deliver value to our customers. From the first day I joined Revolut, the work and people culture have been absolutely amazing! Everyone has a lot of mutual respect for each other and there's a very collaborative spirit in solving problems and working on projects. Revolut is a high growth startup so the career growth opportunities are endless - everyday I'm learning something new and it really motivates me to work harder and go above and beyond.Overall Revolut is a fantastic company to work for and I feel privileged everyday.;The engineering and product teams don't strictly follow Agile Scrum practices so sometimes there's not a disciplined approach to building and delivering products. However on the flip side, this is what makes Revolut a startup and sometimes processes and rules are meant to be broken :);2

There is a clear road map about what you need to do in order to progress to the next level4. Revolut gives a chance to candidates who have had a break in their career5. Excellent maternity policy6. Excellent leave policy7. Working hours are flexible8. Revolut lets you work 60 days from outside the country in a year9. Invests in software that help make employees jobs easier10. The recruitment team that I work with is excellent;1. Revolut has the worst HR ever where when you raise a ticket for a problem being faced, you chase the person the ticket was assigned to but get no reply2. HR makes mistakes and does not want to be held accountable for it and the employees have to suffer unless they take a strong stance3. The management is not on the same page regarding a lot of things and one person would say one thing and the next would be saying the complete opposite which confuses juniors/mids in the teams4. Too many reporting managers with one to one sessions with each of them weekly is a bit too much at times;5

Maybe, if you work 14+ hours/day, give up on anything unrelated to work, dedicate 200% of yourself to achieving KPIs that are not set properly, and pray that they don't find any technicality not to give you a promotion (which I've seen happening numerous times), and it's still a huge MAYBEThe list could go on...;3

You are expected to work long hours, evenings and weekends without a thank you. Seriously damaging to everyone’s mental health. I have personally suffered terribly and line manager didn’t care for a second. There is a mental health first aid program but tbh it’s a plaster over a bullet wound. Expect your manager to chase you every evening asking where things are using the company Instant Messenger system. I recommend not giving your manager your telephone number. 2) There is no support to achieve goals… they call it the A-Team but really it means sink or swim. Goals are impossible to meet and you are set up for failure. Revolut’s top team have an inflated opinion of themselves and think everyone should be a FinTech maniac. People are simply not all the same and this place can’t fathom that. Unfortunately there is a huge turnover of staff so all your colleagues change frequently, friends you’ve made leave and you’re left even more isolated. 3) You may be young but understand the perks here are awful - pension is capped at 50k of salary (not mentioned during recruitment), bonus is nothing compared to what the recruiter promises and this growth shares thing means it’s almost impossible to realise it, no life cover, the “all the tech you could need” comment is a lie. 4) Promotions are extremely hard to come by.

5.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;A lot of responsibility and autonomy for a PO;Apr 13, 2022 - Product Manager;Want I find great about being a PO at Revolut is how much the company trusts the PO to be autonomous.

A PO can make decisions on their own and act very independently. I heard rumours about toxic culture and crazy hours, but have not encountered this at all, at least no more than at any other place I've worked at (I don't think any motivated and driven PO expects a 9 to 5 job without any extra hours at all).;You will probably end up doing more QA work than at other companies, as full responsibility for the product will also mean;0

People do not smile here, from juniors to seniors, nobody. There is no small banter or ""how are you"" or small talk. It is just straight to business all the time, in the coldest manner. This then creates pressure to work in a way that makes you so unhappy, even though the hours aren't necessarily the longest.Those that want to be happy in their jobs/careers leave the company quickly. Those who stay are extremely introverted or workaholics or want to have Revolut on their CV. But, nobody I saw was happy to be there.My experience at Revolut: I knew plenty of people that left within 6 months of joining, myself included. I left within 3 months without having another job or even interviews in place. That should speak for itself. I was so deeply unhappy to the point that I preferred to risk my career over my mental health.People are not horrible or unprofessional here. It's kind of like everyone has accepted that they are not happy. Some people can stick around in that environment, most cannot. I fell into the trap of thinking that I am tough and determined so I will thrive. I was wrong. MBB consultants and MBA holders don't even last here. So, if you think that you're different, I applaud your ambition and mindset but you're probably wrong.Pay is mediocre";32

2.0;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Engineering excellence ruined by toxic product culture;Mar 24, 2021 - Senior Product Manager;Engineers are experienced and genuinely interested in building a good product. If you don't have a technical background, you will pick up a lot of new knowledge.The product moves very quickly and your work can have an impact of millions of people who use the product every day.Everyone is very motivated and hard-working, even if that motivation is driven by fear.;The company is only interested in making money. There is zero interest in understanding or solving customer problems, even when those problems are caused by our product. The approach to problem solving is totally top-down and backwards from the rest of the industry. You will not learn anything at Revolut about product development that will be applicable at other companies that are customer-oriented. You will only learn how to survive at Revolut.On a personal level, it really is a toxic workplace without trust or mutual respect. I think a lot of my colleagues are happy with their jobs because they believe the compensation is good and the experience will further their career, but I do not know a single person who enjoys their work whatsoever.Diversity is also a major issue. Less than 10% of managers are women. Fix this.Finally, the equity compensation system was changed recently and new hires should understand that it is much less beneficial than before. If you are considering taking a job at Revolut, read the fine print carefully and push for cash.;43

You’re hired to get it done, not to come up with ideas. Processes are chaotic and very few things are actually streamlined. Some people are still working towards proving themselves, so 10-12 hours work days are a thing. If you don’t do it, don’t ever expect any kind of meaningful recognition. Work smart, not hard, might be the case, but, let’s not forget, they hire smart people.Quite a few experienced and good engineers have either left or started laying low, just because things don’t seem to change. It’s difficult to find the will to prove yourself in front of someone who gives you no reasons to respect them/inspire you. If you’re a yes man, then be prepared for burnout.Also, having managers telling everyone “good job” on every little thing, is not recognition. Just diminishes the meaning of what “good job” means. And we can tell they don’t actually mean it.;23

The “senior” managers don’t do much while using every single underpaid resource under them to accomplish their goals. There is a huge discrepancy between the compensation and benefits available to the employees in Poland vs. what they give to their employees in London - in terms of sign on bonuses and performance bonuses. Especially if you are working for Customer Support or FinCrime Services departments, you are by default inferior. Targets are very challenging and have not been revised for years. No flexibility in work or sense of job security - if you perform Average minus as they call it, you’re really close to getting fired. Heads of the Departments earning two or three times more than managers simply ignore what’s happening and enjoy their lovely, 8-10 hour daily work lives. Find another company where you would be valued beyond words and work for them. Wouldn’t worth dealing even with egos you’ll meet and have to tolerate.;11

No flexibility in work or sense of job security - if you perform Average minus as they call it, you’re really close to getting fired.

5.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;Challenging and exciting environment with great opportunities;Jul 4, 2020 - Recruiter;I love the fast-paced and exciting environment and the fact that I get to work with a great team and brilliant people throughout the business. The base salaries are good and they offer great benefits (30 days annual leave, free deliveroo, etc.) A lot of complaints in other reviews are about the work-life balance and to be honest it can vary quite a bit depending on departments and individual teams. In my department the work-life balance is very good, in fact it's better than at other companies I've worked at before. The culture of never settling and always striving to be better aligns closely with my personal values, therefore it's a plus for me. However, if your biggest ambition in life is to be home in front of the TV by 6 pm every day, it might admittedly not be for you. I think people need to be aware what working for a start-up is really like before joining with false expectations.;Communication from (senior) management can be less than ideal, some decisions (mostly around internal processes) don't seem to be well thought through.;2

Lack of work-life balance (shifts are being managed in a very strict way, work on weekends is a must, late shifts and night shifts. All of those subjected to business request rather than having actual sense) 2. Downgrade of salary raises and bonuses 3. Inexperienced middle management - most of the decisions relate only to new means of control, generating more pointless rules or spreadsheets. 4. TLs are basically project managers - engaged in so many additional projects that it makes it virtually impossible to manage the people they are leading.5. Stated core values of the company are not being implemented into the actual day to day operation of the department. 6. A great deal of micromanagement and focus on automated tools to verify work - the tools utilized are highly intrusive. 7. FinCrime Dept is purely KPI driven - no need to excel or offer anything else - just keep KPIs high. 8. Lack of recognition of individuals - including the fact there is no formal acknowledgement of additional tasks performed by an employee - even long term ones.9. Unclear career path10. In most instances there are very few policies and regulations available - in most instances, the analyst has to come up with a solution. 11.

An employee might be fired without any meaningful explanations the next day after discussing plans for the next few months with his/her manager.Due to high stress at work, from time to time I have sleep disturbances. The most severe one lasted a whole week and eventually resulted in me calling an ambulance.Everyone's obsessed with KPIs, not the real quality of deliverables. Projects are often badly scoped. As an engineer, you're just a ""resource"" that might be deployed to any project at any time without even asking you.Working long hours is encouraged by the company's culture, although not compulsory. If you're perfect at everything (speed, quality, etc), you'll reach only the ""Intermediate"" level at a performance review. To get a higher score, you'll need to seriously sacrifice your life/work balance.";39
3.0;Former Employee, less than 1 year;Innovating company but complete wrong management;Apr 20, 2020 - Recruiter;I joined Revolut when the company had roughly 700 people at this time they were hiring recruiters like crazy! The hyper-growth phase is ultimately was attracted me and many others to the role. When I joined Revolut it saw me move from agency recruitment into internal recruitment for the first time, as it did pretty much with the entire recruitment team (which was 100+ plus). Here is my honest review: + The company are extremely ambitious and they wont let anything to stop them from achieving the set goals (though this can also be seen as a negative, see below)+ Truly revolutionary product which constantly adds new features. + You will never be bored or have a lack of work, something is always needed to be done+ They give some of the best perks in the market+ Fully set up with everything you need as a recruiter. As well as this you will be set up with pretty much any tech equipment you need (though be warned if you dont return anything when you leave you will be invoiced, something they dont tell you at the start)+ They have some great people and certain departments have a great culture + Good fun company events and regular hosted events in the HQ+ Great company to have on your CV;Now for the downside to working for Revolut. I value my experience here as invaluable but a LOT needs to be changed in order for the business to become a global bank. - The business is always first NEVER the people - No clear career progression. If this is your first inhouse recruitment experience you will pretty much be used a resourcer - You'll be given tight deadlines to hire people but it seems nobody ever wants to interview the candidates. This results in employees not turning up to interviews (believe me it happens a lot), interview cancellations last minute and at the worst they will decide they dont want to interview the candidate anymore when they are due to interview the candidate in 5 minutes! - Be prepared for certain department to ignore you point blank for days on end even with urgent matters. - Be prepared to work long hours. This isnt a 9 to 5 job, you will find yourself working in the office until all hours to achieve your KPIs - KPIs are a MUST . If you underperform in one month then it could be the end of your employment - The business have pretty much hired with short term vision and not long term vision in mind. - The company leaders lack the right management experience. In each area of the business you will have people that are only leading due to having joined the business in the early days. Just because someone has been in the company longest does NOT mean they should be managing or leading. This is a big issue and shows a complete lack of experienced management - Fouders Minions. Nobody knows what they do and they cause more trouble than anything else;67
2.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;Bad management, poor HR practices, would avoid;Apr 18, 2020 - Anonymous Employee;1.  Depending on the team you join, you can work on some v. interesting projects that have big biz impact (even as a new joiner) 2. Processes are coming into place: working practices are efficient and agile which feeds into the rapid results-driven mentality/culture. This is good for a startup as ambitious as Revolut. 3. Flat hierarchy, but as the company continues to grow and teams expand, this is likely to change 4. Work-life balance is not bad at all for a startup.;"1.  *BIG CON*: will fire staff with zero warning + zero transparency. Ie. no past written documentation needed / review history, no vetting of actual reviews submitted by 'managers', no regard for whether or not KPIs have been met etc. Immature management; HR rather clueless/black box. 2. Many instances of 'managers' that are extremely inexperienced and have zero prior leadership experience (leading to 1.) - and do not seem to be interested in leading or people management. Can be very unlucky for those assigned to these managers upon joining. 3. Some service/business teams lack an actual sense of business strategy - leads to disjoined management within teams and lack of clarity (thus, inefficiency + waste).";30

1.0;Current Employee;Sad place for software engineers due to terrible CTO;Jun 23, 2020 - Backend Developer;Decent salary, more or less interesting projects;"CTO mostly focuses on a form rather than substance, he cares deeply about naming things (how HE believes they should be, be ready to become a psychic), but ignores much deeper problems in the development process.For example, postmortems are written, but never discussed, sometimes after a heavy outage the conclusion is ""we did everything right, it is just a coincidence"", pretty much every second one. Usually no action but saying ""do good, don't do bad"" is taken.He surrounded himself with a bunch of yes-men platform team, which feels like more a pool of developers for personal pet projects rather than team that should help others. The only team whose time is valuable, is the platform team, they (or even CTO himself) can introduce breaking changes overnight and then the rest of the backend will do nothing for a couple of days but fix builds in their projects. A cherry on top: whole company uses same stack of dependencies without proper versioning, often reinventing the wheel.Be ready to receive at least once a week a message in a developers slack channel about new ridiculous changes in the development process that you need to remember to follow with zero effort to automate things.The most suffering people from these processes are POs who can't really plan to deliver features, since developers are distracted with BS tasks coming from platform/CTO on a daily basis.Public shaming is also a part of the culture, sometimes CTO drags a link to bitbucket into a public chat to let everyone to discuss what is wrong (in his opinion) with this particular piece of code.";14

Separate voices that run counter to the supervisor's directives are highly undesirable. The company is primarily focused on quantity, not quality. The training system is fictitious. The support program in obtaining e.g. certification is possible only at the TL level upwards. In a word, the key to success in the company - KPI. The company is managed on the basis of deep micromanagement. The career path is unclear, and promotions are commonplace among employees.;12

1.0;Former Employee, more than 1 year;You can do better than work here;Jan 18, 2021 - Sr Recruiter;- Brand recognition is growing but Revolut should (only) be used as a stepping stone into your next role- The opportunity to scale up fast in new subject matter- 30 days annual leave (you will need it!)- An agile way of working - things move and strategy changes quickly but its the best way to grow (I'm a huge advocate of this);Revolut is a 5* product, but sadly, a 1* culture. I left Revolut at my own accord and wanted to leave an honest review. It has been a great learning curve for me and the product is great but unfortunately, I could not support the company culture any longer externally without feeling duplicitous. How Revolut treats its employees is inexcusable - there is a real sense internally that you are disposable and their approach to HR practises and employee relations/experience has been atrocious.  Whilst the appointment of  VP People with actual HR experience is a step in the right direction, it is quite frankly, too late. Revolut is an incredibly challenging environment to feel empowered to do your job. You will be micromanaged from day one and the culture is purely KPI driven in their push to be profitable. Don't get me wrong - KPIs are a great way to track performance against goals but here they are obsessed. As a result, individuals care more about meeting their own KPIs and there is less of a focus on collaboration and team work (despite it being a value) They have made some cracking hires but turnover remains high - either through people being managed out via quarterly performance reviews, or leaving because they are unable to do the job they are hired into because their ideas, creativity and experience (ie., what they've been hired for!) end up misaligned with those in senior leadership. The language used at performance reviews here and throughout the company is aggressive and is also damaging to mental health (in addition to the unsustainable workloads and zero work/life balance) I never was made to feel that I was good enough to work at Revolut - you are either an A player (supposedly the top 5% of the company), or you're a B player (defined as Average+ internally) and you will spend the following 3 months until your next quartlery performance review wondering whether they will be your last. The sad thing is, to get anywhere in Revolut you have to promote this way of working and warped ideology that they are the worlds greatest sports team who only hire the best of the very best, and whilst there are some great people in the business, please trust me when I say that they are far from this. As I said, there are some incredible people here that I am sad to no longer work alongside (the best of luck to you) but for my own sanity and feeling of self-worth, I am incredibly glad to have left the business. My advice to candidates - use Revolut as a stepping stone or just ignore the call from Recruiters. There is no guaratee that you will be with the business in 3 / 6 / 9 months time and they are very open about this on their Culture page and admit that they will literally pay you to leave if you're good, but not the best (!!)  There are plenty of businesses out there that will value you, your experience and your input. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN WORK AT REVOLUT!;89

1.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;Revolut's definition of product owner is very different;Apr 21, 2021 - Product Owner;- Financially rewarding if you stay long enough;Revolut is a relatively big company, so things may be different for different teams. Some thoughts:- Agressive culture from the top. Working extra hours is almost a norm (which wasn't a big issue for me). The COO calls out individuals publicly in large meetings and puts them on the spot for even a small change in due-date. In many cases, the individual may not even have committed to that due date and the due-date was just assumed by management. - Leaders don't have people management skills. They use the term 'crack the whip' to describe some of the work they have to do.- Engineers are seldom involved in solution design because solution design often happens in meetings with senior leaders where engineers are not invited to. This results in a frustrating process.- Product Ownership here is a lot about tactical project management that relies on the traditional 'business requirements' concept, rather than discovery-led product management that uses design-thinking to build better products. - Day-to-day involves putting out operational fires (at least once a week to every other day). This is very distracting from the work you want to do. This is because 'you own the product' and so you own the fire as well. If you don't put out the fires, it'll trigger risk indicators that may lead to you being fired.- There is an emphasis on quantifying everything, even if it comes at the cost of productivity, morale, or peace of mind. - Employee turnover is quite high, but never have I heard any senior leaders or execs asking for any feedback on how they could be better or what can be done differently.- There are a few more but the above are the more important ones I feel.;34

So expect to work 12-15 hours every day and during weekends with no extra pay for overtime hours.- Technical decisions are taken in a rush most of the time taking short cuts which can be risky.- This company pretends too much from yourself and this has affected negatively my private life and I accepted the first offer on the table.";39

2.0;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Overrated political chaos;Jan 29, 2021 - Anonymous Former Employee;- Product is good- Many vacation days_ Looks good on your CV;- Everything is political and not performance based, which is very scary for such a young company - very toxic work culture!- Managers are very inexperienced when it comes to managing people - most of them learn to manage by fear, a thing which is transparently encouraged by Storonsky himself.- Chaos when it comes to synchronising departments - you often have to give up on your personal life just because you dont find out about new tasks in due time. - The only performance reviews that are taken into consideration are done by your line manager, who can be very biased. Even if you hit or even exceed your KPIs, you can get a very bad performance review that can put you in trouble. As crazy as it sounds, yes, you can exceed your KPIs and still be considered an underperformer after your performance review (therefore no bonus, no promotion, no raise). Also, they evaluate you based on the so-called company values, a set of mottos that leave a lot of place for subjectivity.- The take advantage of the 4 reviews/year to get rid of people. They do not announce exits accordingly - one day you just notice that some peoples Slack account has been deactivated.- HR is practically non-existent, they are unable to solve any problems at work, have no internal code of conduct in place, no rules, nothing.- A culture of professional bullies, tolerated and encouraged by high management.- Be careful with Peakon: apparently, they try to measure your well-being at work through these surveys. In reality, everything you say there will be turned against you and you will be considered a bad match for the company. Also, they do not take into consideration employees feedback given through Peakon in order to change things for the better.- They do not know local legislation for some countries and do a lot of illegal stuff - everything you have read about it in the media is true.- Salary below the market average and no other benefits except for a free Metal subscription (no health insurance, no yearly bonus, nothing else).- Role titles do not reflect your experience - in solid companies, you would need much more experience to have such a job title. Here, everybody is a manager/senior manager etc.- I could go on for another hour, but I guess you caught my drift.If you are at the beginning of your career and need a good (yet overrated, in this case) name on your CV, go for it. Otherwise, you will just get extremely frustrated. And dont forget - everything former or current employees say in the media about the work culture is true!;8

You'll get in trouble and they'll find a way to fire you. Or maybe you are simply forced to leave.- Think deeper: If you want to get promotions you have several options. Do your line manager work, get an absurd amount of extra tasks, or simply befriend management. Doing your work is not sufficient, think deeper, guys.- If you liked Game of Thrones this is a pro: The quarter quarterly performance depends on a lot of non-objective factors. What does it mean? If you commit some mistake that goes against the hive mind probably you will be stabbed and your work for the last months will mean zero. And be careful, you can also go on PIP and eventually get fired.

Also, instead of using an existing message queue like Kafka or something else they decided to build their own which has so many problems with reliability and missing features I don’t even know what to say. CultureAs you can tell from the other reviews - the culture sucks & they make you work weekends, deadlines etc...But the worst part of this whole thing is that one day you come in to work & you see your work friend’s Slack account has been deactivated - no warning just fired. This has happened to me a dozen times at Rev now.Also you’ll regularly see people shouting at each other in person like genuinely arguing in the middle of the floor.HRThere is no HR - the head of people is a lackey of the CEO with zero HR experience. Also, they monitor your slack so be careful.CEONik is very smart guy! I really like him as a person having worked with him - he’s very driven & gives good advice. But and this is a big but - Nik sadly isn’t mature enough to be a CEO of a company in our stage.We need to move the focus away from growth & invest in building PnL so I think right now is the right time for him to step down and for Rev to find an experienced CEO to drive the company to profitability.;69

1.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;Don't Consider This Place;Dec 21, 2020 - Anonymous Employee;People are generally nice and passionate about the work they doGood office perks;The general staff turn over here is less than a year. Do your research before you even consider this place. Make sure you are ready to embrace all the negative things about this company. Everything you read here on Glassdoor or Wired Magazine articles, they are all true. You might be lucky to work for a small team that is nice, but that chance is really low because the overall company culture is toxic. Your job security is only for the next three months. 4 performance reviews looking thoroughly into your deliverables will be constant in your day to day life. If you are identified as not performing well, be ready to be fired.I worked really hard and learned a lot. But enough is enough, I am starting to see the signs that this company has on my mental and physical health. Many people stayed because they had no choice. Revolut did a redundancy during the pandemic, salary sacrifice, and people are very scared. Because if you lose your job at this time, it is very difficult to find a new job. Then our CEO said it is ok to micromanage your team until they prove their value to you. The company is looking for perfect execution machines instead of treating you like a person, a human being. People are starting to leave now, important people that have been in this company for some years, this is because the market is getting better and pandemic is not going to be there forever. New opportunities start to come back, the first thing people will do is to leave this place. Don't expect your line managers to care about you, if you fall sick, they won't care how bad you are or even care to ask if everything is ok or get well soon etc. There are no simple kind words in this place to make you feel like you are not just a machine. And you feel it everyday that they don't care about you as a human being, only your deliverables that will help them to climb up the ladder.;64

Instead of focusing on solutions and fixing problems or educating people, some senior engineers / managers prefer to just make fun of other people's lack of skills or point fingers.- People are treated as disposable and will be let go during their probation period for no reason. With luck, they will tell you ""you're not a good fit for the company"".- They tell you that no one forces you to work long hours, but the tasks they give you during your probation force you to work many extra hours and during the weekend.- Job spec advertised completely different from the actual work you'll do (given the speed at which the company is growing, you'll end up doing really crappy work that other people who've been longer in the company don't want to do).";39

1.0;Current Employee;Worst management ever;May 6, 2020 - Product Owner;+ smart colleagues + great for learning and development;Senior management treats employees as mere numbers. CEO openly said managers should gladly let under-performers go during townhall and pointed out employees are being lazy when everyone in the company literally works all the time even during weekend. Good managers are those who can fire employees without a blink. Company recently introduced quarterly performance reviews so they have more opportunities to fire people. Management rules by intimidation. If employees don’t follow certain process or meet certain deadlines, their bonus will get deducted. Senior managements often openly harass employees, calling people idiots and micro manage every little aspects. Some employees are also being let go simply because they disobey orders from above. The remaining employees become too afraid to speak out and just work hard to satisfy requirements from senior management. You don’t get praise when doing a good job but imagine the worst when you screw up. Politics in the company drive teams to work against each other. Every team is too busy optimising their KPI without thinking long term. No resources nor support are provided for personal development. There are materials on HR portal for it but they are not useful at all. Climbing up career ladder in Revolut is a suicide mission. Avoid at all cost.;46

But fine, I took a leap of faith given it was a exciting company rapidly expanding. Day 1 - I was asked whether I could go to Leeds for a week. Nothing about travel was mentioned before getting the job. I have a child I need to look after with my wife. Also there was an expectation to soon travel to Poland for a week. I agreed, then the day before the Leeds trip, as nothing had been communicated to me (train tickets, accommodation) I asked my manager what's happening. She said you're no longer going. Great. Thanks for the heads up. I've made childcare plans but fine. I never really knew what I was supposed to be doing and what I was doing was pretty boring. Training was pretty much non existent. Also, my 'manager' I found wasn't actually my manager but someone who had their own role who was just looking after the team. So I had no real idea what I or my team was doing or what it's goal was - even after asking. KPIs... they were making them up as they went along as it was a new team. So i had no idea what i needed to do to pass it. Again I asked but no one knew. My 'manager' went AWOL after about 4 weeks of me joining & never returned. Wasn't told why. Team then really rudderless. Then lockdown hit. I together with my working wife had to look after our child as nurseries were shut. This massively impacted the amount of work I could do as I was obviously sharing childcare. This meant I couldn't hit whatever the KPIs were. I explained this to my new manager who said yes it must be difficult, but again next week asked why I hadn't hit targets, I explained because of childcare & round in circles we went. Basically Revolut didn't care about that - I needed to hit targets no matter what. In the end they made my who team redundant and said it was nothing to do with Covid. The decision was made before Covid. So why was I hired then because I joined just before Covid hit??? Blatent lie by Revolut who didn't want a bad rep by making people redundant during the crisis. Overall, in my experience, this was a company that didn't really know what it was doing and was making it up as it went along. If people (like me) lost their jobs along the way then so be it.;46

You are micromanaged not only by your manager but by every single individual in the organization (no matter it’s seniority or area of expertise) that believes that it is entitled to criticise your work. Every single thing that you make will have to go to a jira ticket, explained in detail to your manager, to every possible stakeholder, and even to people who have no idea of what you do but they believe that their KPI will be affected by what you are doing even though it is literally not related. Otherwise, you will face the scrutiny of The Wizard of Oz!;10

Now there are a lot of managers, managers of managers, heads of managers, etc.;* Plans are constantly changing;* The CTO wants every developer to use TTD, but in reality the process of software development is often NDD (Nik driven development) as Nik personality likes to set not achievable goals and to push ""product owners"" to deliver things in extremely tight deadlines (using his own motto ""get **it done""). It leads to long working hours and burnouts. You can't say anything good about quality in such an environment; * No QA (literally: there are 3 QA engineers, who are working with mobile developers, no QA for the frontend or backend at all);* Recently they added 2 other opportunity to fire people. This is 2 additional performance periods (so it's 4 performance periods a year). They call it ""performance checkpoint"" and it happens quarterly now. With the only difference: there is no way to get a promotion or bonus, but you can get fired;* The performance review process is broken: you can ask people to review you, but the only opinion which is important is the opinion of your ""product owner"", which obviously can be biased + ""product owners"", as they are mostly non-technical people, don't really understand what exactly you've done + last ""performance checkpoint"" all the POs were ultimately asked to decrease marks they set for their team members;* As a result they started to fire people without warnings (about 100 people this quarter based on some internal rumors);* The way how they fire people is awful: this is an often case, when you have a meeting with a person in the morning, but next day you see just ""Account deactivated"" in Slack; * They use the ""product owner"" term which can sound like this is a position described in some Agile frameworks, but don't let to fool yourself: this is just a word they use to call ordinary product managers. Most of them don't own their products and act as proxies between Nik and a team. Also, micromanagement is one of the favourite strategies to manage people;* You never know what you should do to get a promotion or a pay raise. The only way to get is your ""product owner"" specifically asks to promote you, but considering they fire people (and ""product owners"" as well) often, there is a chance to find yourself in a team with a person as a manager who barely knows anything about you and how you've worked.";55

4.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;Interesting experience;May 18, 2020 - Anonymous Employee;In order to thrive at Revolut, culture fit is really important.I see a lot of negative reviews stating bad management, and in a way I think this is highly driven by an extremely direct and no-BS communication style of the senior management. The narrative is highly focused on the need for all to be super performers (aka A players) and if you fall outside of this group, you'll be fired. Now, this sounds pretty rough to most people (and that is in a way understandable) and creates an impression that the company and/or senior management does not care about people. Guess what - other/bigger companies who are better at BSing and sugar coating also do not care, but there is more 'fake empathy' going on there. So I guess this is a question of culture/personality type - do you prefer straightforwardness and blunt communication or would you rather have the same stuff delivered in a corporate sugar coated/brainwash-y way? Each person would have a different response to that :) Based on this here are the Pros:-> moves fast, things get resolved quickly-> smart colleagues, especially in some departments. A players like working with A players-> high performance culture (good for those who are competitive and want to be no.1)-> to the point above, despite that, people are also friendly and backstabbing is not so common (as it is in corporate)-> management is actually here for the win and is relentless to reach its goals (this is good monetary-wise if you stick long term and see the company IPO);Cons:-> senior management communication style is indeed rough/immature - rephrasing things may do wonders for the morale-> unexpected spikes in workload may occur - which makes work/life balance challenging-> [pre-covid] office perks are not that amazing - you have to wait till 7 pm for Deliveroo dinner and the breakfast provided is kind of basic (only 1 sugar free cereal was available, which were the plain outs, everything else was loaded with sugar)-> lack of narrative/culture/identity of being part of something awesome - there isn't a strong identity that creates a sense of community and belonging, something you can find in big tech companies;5

Second line support team created behind the back of everyone, with no recruitment. Some people were taken there automatically, ""just because"". There are many experienced people left, with no chances to grow at the moment, with some duties suddenly taken from them. In terms of responsibilities and tasks at work, they are now at the same level as new joiners- not enough appreciation or recognition if you do something extra- poor communication with team leaders (some of them should even not have that position)- unrealistic goals and KPIs with increasing pressure every day; no overtime allowance for a couple of months- very poor product launch (I'm not talking about the Product Launch team - they are great and they do their best) - the process itself and the communication with the product owners is so poor that I was never excited about the launch of a new feature in the app. There was always something wrong, not working, not tested enough.

1.0;Former Employee, less than 1 year;An honest review;Jun 2, 2020 - Anonymous Employee;This will be my honest review. I joined Revolut a few months ago and was excited to join a challenging environment. I recently resigned due to a combination of reasons, which is unusual because people are usually terminated here, they don't really get to resign.Pros:1) You will learn a lot. The learning curve is steep here from the moment you join. I think I had a couple hours introduction and the next day I was submerged in work. I learnt more in the first couple of weeks here than I did in previous jobs.2) You will not be bored. I have not come across anyone who just sat around with nothing to do. You are pretty much at full capacity most of the time.3) Free healthy snacks. Cheeky perk, but it they have free breakfast, drinks, snacks etc.4) Free Deliveroo after 7pm (£15 including delivery cost)5) Intelligent people below middle management. I worked predominantly with data people and they were some of the most competent and smart people I have worked with.6) The results of your effort are seen. Revolut is output focused, What is good is that they implement a way for you to see how your individual KPI impacts different levels of the company. i.e. Team KPI, Department KPI, Company KPI.;"To be honest, I actually left because I ended up having mental health problems because of working at Revolut, to the point where I suffered from daily panic attacks and breathing problems, and ended up in hospital. I found that while working there I became more toxic and angry. Even my partner had noticed I was always stressed and severely unhappy. However, I'll try to be fair with the cons and provide explanation.If you want to skip all the details I summarised the 7 points right at the bottom.Cons:General:1) No work-life balance. You will work minimum 9-12 hours a day - I sometimes was in office till midnight or later. That's why they offer the perk of free UBER trips from the office to your house if you are in office past midnight. The perk is there for a reason. I'm not saying this is an objectively bad thing. Some people like this kind of lifestyle and that is fine, for me it wasn't great. In my opinion, this isn't a place you would want to work at if you want to maintain a life outside of work. Again, this is debatable depending on what you want out of life.2) The culture is very toxic. Management (middle, senior, execs) view people as resources and not people. They say they are changing, and they will probably reply to this review saying 'They are working on it...', but trust me when I say: this is not a priority for the company. They are output driven, which means they don't care how the results are produced, as long as they are produced; even if that means working 15 hours a day, everyday. When I was joining, I was assured that they are working on improving their culture and focusing on employees. This was not true, at all. Essentially, they just implemented a room with curtains that you can pull shut, where you could go if you were stressed to relax a bit. But here's the catch - since deadlines don't move and everything is output driven, - the longer you stayed in that room, the longer you had to stay after hours just to meet the demanding deadlines. Bottom line: it wasn't much help and this was Revolut's only solution to mental health problems in the work place, even after the hundreds of review comments via internal surveys and platforms like Glassdoor telling management, that the current work place is not sustainable for most people.Just to summarise: you probably won't be seen as an individual unless you get to a level in management. BUT there are a small amount of teams which implement their own culture and phenomenal to work for... I just hope you get into one of these few teams, if not.... god bless you and good luck.3) Management are way too inexperienced - most of the managers there aren't people who have experience in their role, but are in exec positions because they were early employees. This leads to certain problems: - Young successful people in high positions are trying to prove that they deserve their exec levels, so they implement unreasonable targets and asks which people below have to run around and jump through hoops to meet.- Just pure inexperience and lack of leadership and direction - sometimes it honestly feels like they don't know what they are doing and then saying they need something 10 mins before a meeting. There have been instances where management have agreed to implement something by a deadline only to find that they don't even have data to complete the task because management didn't discuss anything with the data people and just guessed if they had information or not. Which again means that people below have to bend over backwards.- Just unprofessional - Its not uncommon for people to yell at each other there and management to get at each others throats because there is simply no communication between them (again: inexperience). Sometimes because of no experience management does not understand the weight of the words they write or say. They are senior managers and a lot of people look up them. They can be often inappropriate, and since they are young, they don't quite grasp that some of things they say can cause serious problems... I get that they are a start-up but if you want to be a bank (or just a respectable company), you should probably act with some more professionalism.Again to summarise - young inexperienced people are in really high places here.4) The concept of 'A-Players'. Revolut is obsessed with this term. Essentially they only want the best of the best to work for them. Don't misunderstand: they do not want to train and develop their employees to become A-players and grow. NOPE. They want people to be A-players right when they join. Whats-more, is that this terms has created a divide in the company into the 'GREATS' and the 'COMMONERS'. The greats being the A-players (people who have outstanding performance reviews and are only a small fraction of people in the company). The Peasants being the other 80% or so of the company. This divide is a serious psychological problem where you have to be in the ELITE group otherwise you are worthless in the company. It's so bad that it has come to the point that your feedback on internal surveys to improve Revolut doesn't carry much weight in the company unless you are one of these 'A-Players'. Its like a sad school drama show...5) The general attitude of the company is 'We are amazing and you should be grateful to work for us'... This isn't a bad thing to some degree, it's good that they are proud of themselves, but I think it is blown way out of proportion. From the moment you apply to Revolut the attitude is on the arrogant side - they believe that they only deserve the best of the best - but what they do not understand is that an 'A-player' wants to work in an 'A-Class' company like Google, Microsoft or the other Tech Titans. It's evident from the company reviews and ratings on this platform and many others that the company is not at the level that they can demand just the A-players from around the world.6) The compensation is good compared to the market (not by much). What you need to understand is that Revolut is in a league of its own: if you compare the amount of hours you work to the pay they give you, you will understand that you are actually being underpaid.For example if you work at 2 companies ABC, XYZ.ABC pay you £1000 a week but you work 45 hours a week (standard contract)XYZ pay you £1200 a week but you work 60 hours a week (12 hours a day and pay a bit better than market)ABC are paying you £22.22 an hour while XYZ are paying you £20 an hours.Of course it is not always like this, but before you think that they are paying you more than your previous job, weigh up the pay in comparison to the extra level of work you will be doing (not to mention emotional abuse and potential mental health repercussions).7) Line managers are quite poor here. Not everyone, but a lot of them are not qualified to be line managers. In my experience, they offer no support, and are very quick to blame you. My manager didn't even know what my career progression goals were, I was just a expendable resource to them. They are usually too busy for you, which they tend use as an excuse for not performing their line managing duties and proceed to blame you that you didn't 'manage upward enough' which is just another way of them getting out of their line managing duties. Even when you request a new line manager they refuse to let you go and change, because I guess it looks bad on them, so you end up stuck with a line manager that doesn't pay much attention to your growth. My worst experience was when another team wanted me to work for them and I wanted to work for that team, only to be blocked by my current line manager telling me I can't go. Later I was in a meeting with other managers and my line manager, when my manager said:""Some managers are bad, line managers shouldn't block someone's internal move to a team they are more suited to because people leave and then apply externally"".I just sat in that meeting honestly really upset about the situation since the same manager blocked my internal move and then made themselves seem like a thoughtful leader coming up with this solution, when in reality they were doing the exact thing they were preaching against. That was the final moment before I decided I can no longer work there. That and the series of panic attacks I had while working there, I could name other terrible things that happened but I think this review is long enough... TO SUMMARISE1) NO WORK-LIFE BALANCE2) CULTURE IS TOXIC3) MANAGEMENT IS YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED4) CONCEPT OF A-PLAYERS CREATES A CLASS SYSTEM IN THE COMPANY5) REVOLUT HAS A PRETENTIOUS ATTITUDE6) PAY IS NOT GOOD WHEN PUT IN PERSPECTIVE WITH THE HOURS WORKED7) LINE MANAGERS CAN HONESTLY BREAK YOUR EXPERIENCE THERE AND BREAK YOU";64

Now there are a lot of managers, managers of managers, heads of managers, etc.;* Plans are constantly changing;* The CTO wants every developer to use TTD, but in reality the process of software development is often NDD (Nik driven development) as Nik personality likes to set not achievable goals and to push ""product owners"" to deliver things in extremely tight deadlines (using his own motto ""get **it done""). It leads to long working hours and burnouts. You can't say anything good about quality in such an environment; * No QA (literally: there are 3 QA engineers, who are working with mobile developers, no QA for the frontend or backend at all);* Recently they added 2 other opportunity to fire people. This is 2 additional performance periods (so it's 4 performance periods a year). They call it ""performance checkpoint"" and it happens quarterly now. With the only difference: there is no way to get a promotion or bonus, but you can get fired;* The performance review process is broken: you can ask people to review you, but the only opinion which is important is the opinion of your ""product owner"", which obviously can be biased + ""product owners"", as they are mostly non-technical people, don't really understand what exactly you've done + last ""performance checkpoint"" all the POs were ultimately asked to decrease marks they set for their team members;* As a result they started to fire people without warnings (about 100 people this quarter based on some internal rumors);* The way how they fire people is awful: this is an often case, when you have a meeting with a person in the morning, but next day you see just ""Account deactivated"" in Slack; * They use the ""product owner"" term which can sound like this is a position described in some Agile frameworks, but don't let to fool yourself: this is just a word they use to call ordinary product managers. Most of them don't own their products and act as proxies between Nik and a team. Also, micromanagement is one of the favourite strategies to manage people;* You never know what you should do to get a promotion or a pay raise. The only way to get is your ""product owner"" specifically asks to promote you, but considering they fire people (and ""product owners"" as well) often, there is a chance to find yourself in a team with a person as a manager who barely knows anything about you and how you've worked.";55

1.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;Worst Company Culture Ever;Jul 4, 2020 - Product Owner;Interesting work, fast paced. Never ending grand ambition of world domination.;Worst work culture ever, PERIOD.Everyone is being pushed nonStop by the CEO and his minions. Extremely arrogant product heads who think they know everything , but in reality they hardly have developed anything great. CEO and product head don't want to listen, just push and push all that time, thinking that's their job.Deadlines are from thin air, they are unbelievably ridiculous but you have to stick to them. Product Head always works with the assumption that people are slacking, and hence pushes unnecessarily. It can drive anyone mad.If you are a product guy interviewing with this company and getting sold by the growth and by HR, don't be fooled. Your product skills are not required here, what is required are puppets who can without challenging just implement what CEO says.;44

In my opinion it should be the responsibility of Product Owner not developers. Since I do not like this part of job I struggled a lot- Fired because underperformance in the middle of Covid outbreake. It was difficult to understand because the interview process took more or less one month and they waited an extra few months before I turned up in the office. I was let go without being informed in advance that I was falling behind expectations and I was expected to improve- It is not 9 to 5 job- People are extremely busy and you probably will never receive any help from your mates if that does not help them achieve KPIs;11

1.0;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Never work at Revolut;Jun 9, 2020 - Product Owner;Compensation is pretty in the market;"To be honest, it's the worst company I've ever worked for. Never work here, you will have only regrets and stress. Company and founders don't understand product, technology and good culture at all. You won't be doing product. It's digital transformation company:- 100% top-down company, all design, roadmap, etc. decisions are made by Nikolay Storonsky. You will be only in charge of execution/project management. He is reviewing every new screen and epic every week with every team (Revolut has 50+ teams). All middle managers are just proxies, no decisions, no their own opinions and easily blow you in back. - Not product way of thinking at all, in a year I haven't seen any team made user research and A/B test. All development is done in an absolutely blind way, guided by the supervision of Nikolay. Moreover, all these instruments are prohibited and replace with ""thinking deeper"" value that means just sit and think a lot. Nikolay personally hates these methods and several times told me that it's for idiots.- The short-sighted, company mostly focused on small improvements that can be done in 1-2 week otherwise it's too much risk and should be cancelled. - Every two weeks you will have a review with your functional manager who will be checking Jira epics and Figmas to verify that you have enough words there, structure, etc. (no one really cares for product stuff) - Did you say strategy? These guys don't have any understanding of their client, such as personas, segments, key pain points, etc.- Never ever question Nik's opinions and decisions! He is always right, otherwise, you are fired immediately. Stronger together!!!That's super sad because there are so many good and shiny managers fooled and hired from cool companies that struggling with topics above and leaving. During interviews, people and recruiters will tell you and even test you on the product skills above but it will last time you will ever use it. From technology and quality perspective company is messy as well:- There are no QA engineers and that's could be ok if you have autotests but Revolut mostly doesn't have it. They do have it only for backend and no one care for web and apps. All QA work is on PO shoulders. Yes yes yes, you will be doing here QA and project management but not product work. And as you can imagine PO doesn't have time and nobody QA it at all.- CTO, Vlad is really obsessed about reviews, reports and can't handle any feedback, the same as Nikolay. Every two weeks you would be measured against 10-15 parameters (most of them are really stupid) and you can't question any decision and situation (such people usually immediately fired). All of this lead to fear of punishment, making mistake - developers producing a lot of small crappy improvements to minimise their risk.- Most of the codebase written in rush by students, so it's really buggy and re-inventing existing technologies and frameworks messily. As you can understand, it isn't a modern stack and very hard learning curve.Based on the information above it's pretty clear that you won't be trusted and company culture is very toxic. They call it A-players or champions. We should hire and retain only them. In practice, Revolut fires everyone who is average or below it - you should be excellent. Last mid review we were told that we doing just feedback sessions. All this information was used to fire people immediately, even with average feedback. Most of the senior managers are just kids, doing that they were told. It's their first job, their working here for 2-3 years and haven't ever seen how good job should look like. So, you will have a fun time.";48

4.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;Interesting experience;May 18, 2020 - Anonymous Employee;In order to thrive at Revolut, culture fit is really important.I see a lot of negative reviews stating bad management, and in a way I think this is highly driven by an extremely direct and no-BS communication style of the senior management. The narrative is highly focused on the need for all to be super performers (aka A players) and if you fall outside of this group, you'll be fired. Now, this sounds pretty rough to most people (and that is in a way understandable) and creates an impression that the company and/or senior management does not care about people. Guess what - other/bigger companies who are better at BSing and sugar coating also do not care, but there is more 'fake empathy' going on there. So I guess this is a question of culture/personality type - do you prefer straightforwardness and blunt communication or would you rather have the same stuff delivered in a corporate sugar coated/brainwash-y way? Each person would have a different response to that :) Based on this here are the Pros:-> moves fast, things get resolved quickly-> smart colleagues, especially in some departments. A players like working with A players-> high performance culture (good for those who are competitive and want to be no.1)-> to the point above, despite that, people are also friendly and backstabbing is not so common (as it is in corporate)-> management is actually here for the win and is relentless to reach its goals (this is good monetary-wise if you stick long term and see the company IPO);Cons:-> senior management communication style is indeed rough/immature - rephrasing things may do wonders for the morale-> unexpected spikes in workload may occur - which makes work/life balance challenging-> [pre-covid] office perks are not that amazing - you have to wait till 7 pm for Deliveroo dinner and the breakfast provided is kind of basic (only 1 sugar free cereal was available, which were the plain outs, everything else was loaded with sugar)-> lack of narrative/culture/identity of being part of something awesome - there isn't a strong identity that creates a sense of community and belonging, something you can find in big tech companies;5

1.0;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Lack of experienced management leads to bad decisions and culture;Jun 18, 2020 - Anonymous Employee;You will work with smart people. You will work on projects that impact millions of customers. The product is a great product.;"Each team has progress check ins with the CEO each week. You have a very short period of time to convince the CEO that your idea and designs are the best solution. Most of the time, he already has a solution in mind and if your solution does not match with his exactly, you will be publicly called an ""idiot"" or ""stupid"" and he will threaten to replace you with ""someone who can do this right"" without explaining what you did wrong. The CEO does not have time to fully understand the problem and yet he makes every decision for you, down to button colours in your design. This results in suboptimal decision making and then teams release features that customers do not like or use.There is no customer problem focused decision making. Every decision is made based on how much money we can make as a company. Testing and customer research is actively discouraged and if you run an experiment such as an A/B test, you will be considered “stupid” for not being able to use your own brain to determine the optimal outcome. There is no testing to measure the result of each decision made so it is assumed that each decision made by the CEO was successful.Product leaders in the company do not have adequate product and leadership experience at other companies prior to joining Revolut. They are promoted from within for being loyal and staying at the company for years. The result is that the product leaders do not know how to create company level roadmaps and do not know how to properly prioritise projects and resources. Each team is only aware of their own priorities and only have a limited idea for how it compares to the company goals. Product owners with limited or no product experience have no one to learn from and cannot grow their skills, especially with consistent crazy deadlines to hit. Since there are no clear company roadmap and goals, priorities change on a weekly basis. Your own impactful ideas get moved down the backlog and you consistently have 5-10 people asking for different things from you. The ""get it done"" culture expects you to complete everything immediately. This is obviously impossible. The result is that you prioritise the tasks that belong to people who chase you the most. Other people expect you to drop everything you are working on to work on their problem. If you do not prioritise it, they will include you in slack messages with a senior leader from their team who does not understand your other priorities and will force you to complete their specific task. The chase culture here is intense. It is impossible to actually prioritise the most impactful items your team can work on. Every team becomes an execution team and no one has time or opportunity to come up with their own ideas.Most people here believe in the product and want Revolut to succeed. The unfortunate reality is that the constant priority shifting, lack of product thinking and threats to replace everyone demoralises all the employees. Most people are not motivated to their best work and people are quitting every week. I understand the frustration that the CEO must be feeling. He expects each team to come up with creative ideas and innovate but each team is so busy with hitting their KPIs that they do not have time to think and do customer research. There are no leaders who are pushing for change since we have realised that questioning the CEO's decisions is not worth losing your job over. As a result, the CEO does not see innovative work from the teams and thinks they are not capable. The team then gets replaced and the whole cycle starts over again.";23
1.0;Current Employee;Sad place for software engineers due to terrible CTO;Jun 23, 2020 - Backend Developer;Decent salary, more or less interesting projects;"CTO mostly focuses on a form rather than substance, he cares deeply about naming things (how HE believes they should be, be ready to become a psychic), but ignores much deeper problems in the development process.For example, postmortems are written, but never discussed, sometimes after a heavy outage the conclusion is ""we did everything right, it is just a coincidence"", pretty much every second one. Usually no action but saying ""do good, don't do bad"" is taken.He surrounded himself with a bunch of yes-men platform team, which feels like more a pool of developers for personal pet projects rather than team that should help others. The only team whose time is valuable, is the platform team, they (or even CTO himself) can introduce breaking changes overnight and then the rest of the backend will do nothing for a couple of days but fix builds in their projects. A cherry on top: whole company uses same stack of dependencies without proper versioning, often reinventing the wheel.Be ready to receive at least once a week a message in a developers slack channel about new ridiculous changes in the development process that you need to remember to follow with zero effort to automate things.The most suffering people from these processes are POs who can't really plan to deliver features, since developers are distracted with BS tasks coming from platform/CTO on a daily basis.Public shaming is also a part of the culture, sometimes CTO drags a link to bitbucket into a public chat to let everyone to discuss what is wrong (in his opinion) with this particular piece of code.";14

CULTURE - Toxic and worst I ever saw. Very political, super hierarchical. It is not a startup, but huge corporate machine. - There were few comments below about favoritism, it is true - if you are a friend of CEO/SVP Revenue/Head of Legal - you have a chance in this company. If god forbid you tell those guys truth in their face - you can just leave the next day, your life in Revolut will be miserable. - Revolut is a company of one man, and nobody inside are able to stand up against CEO's opinion or decisions even though when everybody in the room understand he tells BS. - Culture is a fear driven, people are scared to be fired, and in the most recent environment and lack of job options elsewhere that results in the fact that most folks just conform with the stupidity and nonsense that is going on inside. COMPANY You may hear a lot from recruitment teams and hiring managers, but just know one thing - they lie. They are desperate to hit their recruitment KPIs which they are measured on, hence they have full incentive to tell you whatsoever, to make sure you sign the contract. Keeping you in the company is a problem and KPI of HR team, hence Recruitment dont care. People development is not a company priority, really. Most probably, L&D person will respond to my review and explain everything is different - but trust me, no one cares about your growth in this company. This is what you will get in Revolut: - Nobody cares about your development - Nobody cares about your wellbeing - Nobody cares about your health (especially mental because it will be brought to extreme edge) - Nobody cares about you. You are just a resource for CEO/Revolut to get from point A to point B. Once you hit your own limit (and you will, in many cases not because of your professional limitations but due to unreasonable targets that are being increased every 3 months without and proper logic behind it), you will be considered as redundant and get fired. - People are being fired in 1 day. On all levels. You met with your manager yesterday, discussed long term plans and how you will organise the work in the next 2-3 months, and the next thing you know, her/his account is deactivated next morning and unless you exchange phone numbers, you will never hear from this person ever again.FUNCTION - Reading articles on Wired, you may have noticed departure of 2 CFO, 1 deputy CFO and 1 Head of Finance over 1.5 years. Churn in Finance leadership is worse than in customer support organisation. - As a result, finance function is one big problem in Revolut, company doesn't even know how much cash they are burning every month. Instead of relying on accounting function and proper reporting tools, in a typical for Revolut manner they diverted group of developers to build another in-house half-baked solution to prepare financial results for the company which are being considered as 100% correct. - Accounting team is severely understaffed. My team mates were suffocating with the amount of work load and information to process, working for 14-16 hours a day and in the end either fired or considered as underperforming. I heard CEO saying at the finance function-wide meeting: ""You are just an accountant"". This is the attitude you are going to get if you hold ACCA, multi-years in Big4 and join this company. I feel I didnt express enough but I hope this should warn some bright people and prevent them from joining this filthy institution. While I have met some fo the smartest people in the world here, I warn future stars to not choose to work in Revolut. I think only this kind of market boycott will make the leadership think about how much they value employees as humans and not human resources.";15

This is good and bad.-Great product. -Dynamic environment.;-It's just another corporation with a nice disguise, and it's a business-first one, you feel like you are doing outsourcing, you are just a number. -You go to the office knowing that any day can be your last day, they even boast during the onboarding process of firing entire teams. -As everything turns around the KPIs it's not an easy thing to get to know your co-workers, there is no time for that. -Managers and team leaders with zero experience and no idea about managing people. -There are no personal development plans or career paths.-Shifts and working on weekends because there is not enough space for the employees in the office.-The procedures get outdated from one day to another -are split into different places- and if you have doubts there is no SMEs, is your problem to figure out the right thing -no one can guarantee that the solution you get from your team leader/manager is the correct one... and that's your problem, not his/her-. -Disorganized place. Amateur behavior. -No feedback, good or bad, because the team leaders/managers don't care as long as the KPIs are met.;12

3.0;Current Employee, more than 3 years;You can learn a lot but you won't be rewarded for above average work;May 29, 2020 - Java Developer;+ Revolut moves very fast, there are new features released every few weeks so you get a lot of opportunities to do something new & learn.+ Work here is very satisfying as you get to do stuff that's used by millions of user and it's delivered to them every two weeks.+ You can participate in the recruitment process which can improve your soft and technical skills from a different direction+ Base salary above average+ Work is very well organized as you know what's expected from you and when you have to deliver something, the lower management is doing a good job at keeping everything tight. Although that might be just my case, a lot of people have crappy managers who don't know how to manage and sometimes are bullies.;- No bonus, there are performance reviews and if you did a good job then the only thing you get are options for stocks which are worth nothing. Ideally you should be able to sell them during funding rounds which happen every few years but it's not possible as only small subset of people are allowed to sell a small subset of their stocks thanks to very picky conditions. Most of the people have never turned their stocks into something valuable hence there's no bonus and no appreciation of your good work.- If you'd like to learn something new that you don't already do at work then there are no opportunities as company doesn't provide any access to learning platforms/ebooks so people can't step up their game- Management thinks that that adding a congrats bot will solve the problem of not being rewarded for great work;2
1.0;Former Employee, less than 1 year;This company does not deserve your effort;Jun 15, 2020 - FinCrime Analyst;It's a good line on your CV, that's it.;"I have always been a top performer at work, and I moved to Poland just to take this role with Revolut. I thought this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Now I really hope it is, because I never want to have an experience like this again.There is no training provided here. You get a one week company induction, not related to your role and that's it. You are then expected to start working immediately.I had to learn most processes and workflows by myself because most of my probation period was spent working from home during lock down. I improved my own quality score to 100%, which I thought was great, but no. The company does not care about the quality of your work, only quantity. I thought this was fine, as I was clearly overachieving the productivity target anyway.2 weeks before the end of my probation, management completely changed our KPIs. This wasn't just a slight tweak, it was a huge overhaul. They changed what counted as productivity without understanding the daily work of the department. This meant I had to relearn how to do the job in order to achieve this ridiculous new target. I wasn't alone, 3/4 of the team could not achieve the new target. despite the challenge, I more than doubled my score, but it wasn't enough. I was released at the end of my probation due to ""under performance"" I don't understand how they could have come to that decision, with all the hard work and dedication I put in prior. I was told ""Sorry, it's the end of your probation and you're not at 100% of the target. Bye"" They waited until my last day to let me know.Our team had huge backlogs, with customers waiting 3+ days for assistance. I spent most of my last 2 weeks trying to clear this, but management didn't consider this to be ""productive"" as it didn't contribute to targets, despite customers still being team priority. Going above and beyond your line of duty is not valued or respected here.I was so incredibly naive to think that my contribution was valuedBecause of this, I was left stranded in Poland for 2 months without any source of income. Revolut don't care...It makes me feel so sick when I see Revolut posting about ""valuing"" employes on social media.To summarize:- Management does not care if you are good or bad at your job, they just care about quantity of work done.- Management do not offer any support or guidance to employees, until the day they want to fire them- Being a team player or going above and beyond in any situation is not valued, in fact, they don't care. They only care about productivity.- Management will completely change KPIs and expectations with no guidance and they will quickly fire you if you don't achieve them, even if you have to completely relearn how to work to achieve them.- Management don't even know about the work that they are setting KPIs for- Little to no training provided.";8
1.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;No work life balance, Management only cares about your works not you.;May 1, 2020 - Software Engineer;- Competitive salary/benefits- Talented people.- Some nice perks;"- A lot of pressure going on in engineer area.- Developers are blame each others when someone accidentally break the dev environment/branch making them feels shame, rather than helping and stop blaming in the chat group.- No mistake are acceptable, if you are good in everything -> you got only 50% performance review (which is meets expectation). They raise the employee standard, but lack of engineering process and good culture. (They expect all of you to be ""above"" expectation)- No work life balance/ everyone works like 10+ hours a day to ""Get things done"". They was no real task estimation, product side are very keen to push their product because they are racing each others to proof them self and to showing off to their CEOs. Most of people left because of that.- They're doing task demo every 1-2 weeks and gather all developer (100+ people more) to watch what every teams are doing. Which is not necessary anymore when the company have more than 100+ people in tech team. It's kinda wasting time and I don't think everyone can remembered what is going on.- They was no engineering manager position which can solve and made a decision in some technical side, as a developer you will report to product owner in your team (Which is very bad, some of product owner doesn't even care about engineering process, they just want to ""Get things done""). You also have functional manager (Which is some developer who have more seniority) But they can only help you in some advices for implementation.- They used to have QA department, which is good, because if your team & product are get bigger they should have some one who creating & responsible in quality assurance. But then they decided to collapsed it because they think focus on ""pushing"" features are more important.- Since there is no QA department, sometimes you & your team will got assigned to some bugs and complaints directly- Not so friendly environment, when everyone still working in the office, no one talking to you if they don't want some answer that related to works, (Because they have a lot of workloads and try to ""get things done""). Some people are going have a lunch together, but that's all.- Even after all of the above complaints, CEOs and top management still saying that since the company get bigger, we are start to get lazy (What?!, everyone needs to work long hour for you guys everyday to be enough?) - Rather than try to encourage/help and give a constructive feedback to employee that underperform in some point. They probably fired you because they don't have time for that, they wants to ""get things done""";30

1.0;Former Employee;Toxic Environment. Incompetent Managers. And so on. Please avoid.;Jun 7, 2020 - Customer Support Specialist;Cereals, fruits, variants of milks, soft drinks, are always available in the kitchen.Free dinner and taxi for the evening shift.You are mostly surrounded by nice colleagues, but still there are a few people who think that they are perfect and look down on other people. Fast recruitment process.IT team is very responsive, appreciate the great work.;Fear-driven environmentUnrealistic target. If you want to work like a human being, not a robot, the target is quite unachievable. If you ask the person who set the target to do the exact same thing as the Support Agents should do, for sure they cannot handle it.No time to be up to date. For example, when you have days off for two days in a week, you miss a lot of information, when you get back to work, you must be ready for all the changes and news. So they are expecting you to be updated even if it’s taking your free/leisure/unpaid time to read it. Please keep in mind that the CS Specialist is the lowest position, with the lowest salary, and still they expect people to spend extra time for them. Chaotic, messy internal information/procedure. When there is a product launch/issue, quite often no one knows what is really happening. Even their knowledge base is quite confusing/messy, not all information is covered. They don’t care if you go the extra mile to investigate the cases thoroughly. Again, most of the time they do not have a procedure settled for something, so you need to create a totally brand new procedure, but it requires a big effort and time. Another thing is when a case is quite complicated, it is taking your time, you want to do your best to solve it, but you are also stressed out cause then you will not meet your target. They don’t care about the quality of your work, they’d rather appreciate careless employees as long as the numbers are high. If you are a diligent person who takes things into consideration, you want to give the best of your work, then avoid this company, they don’t deserve your effort. Regarding the way they treat the daily target, basically their logic is like this: Let’s make a tree-climbing competition. The participants would be a monkey and a dolphin. When the dolphin loses, they said to him/her: Well… Monkey could win, so why are you not able to win? We have done a fair competition here. Team Leaders are not leaders. They are just calculating your performance.weekly. They don’t know how to manage people, they are there to press the staff. Also, their work is not transparent to everybody so no one knows what they exactly do. Most of them don’t even know the product, yet you must consult with them for some decisions, no wonder when you ask them to take a decision, they are mostly scared to take action. Of course, not all of them are bad, but there are only a few good Team Leaders. They always think about money and profit so they want you to be an expert on anything. It is expensive to hire an expert or specialist in its field. There is a topic where they expect you to know everything about that in one hour. Yes you are given the time to read for maximum one hour, and you are already the “specialist” for it. While if you go to finance major in university, it probably could take one semester the minimum, They don’t want to give you more time for it. But again, why pay more when you could pay less. Time is money. They fired you without warning. And in the meeting they just deactivated your Slack account so you cannot contact anyone else in the company, they gave a limited time to choose which option of the contract. No time to consult with a lawyer, it is a total bully, someone should not be pressed like that, in fact they should have time to think. Remind me of Orwell’s 1984.;12

All the work can be done in time, as long as you work efficiently and don't waste time. I'd recommend it to people - especially as it's growing, so the right time to come in and invest effort into making it a global giant.;Onboarding is a total baptism by fire and needs major restructuring to help new starters get settled and comfortable with their work and resources.

5.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;AMAZING - I feel at home <3;Nov 29, 2019 - Human Resources Manager;I work at Porto Office (Portugal)The environment is amazing, people really connect with each other and help each other. If you have a problem or doubt, you go directly to some member of another team and they help you. No judgements or bad faces, at all. We're all here to learn and improve, and we all have the same goal.We have maybe around 40% international co-workers, and 60% native. This is incredible as well in so many ways.The benefits and perks are medium-high compared to the rest of the market.There are several internal events and initiatives that really engage people and gives them a continuous feel that . You can really identify with the company and culture and values! The company is changing each day, with improvements coming along each day. And every week, you see that the mindset is becoming more and more people-focused :) The brand new Office, which will hold around 450 people, is a-ma-zing. Gives you a sense of comfort and belonging, and the idea that you have the best workplace you could ask for.Plus, the company has some internal strategies that are really incredible: for example every week, we have a broadcast from another office, to update everyone on the current status of the company in the market, about the new initiatives and plans, about new processes and procedures, about everything else that might matter and that might be important for everyone to know. This keeps people in the loop and motivated.;As any fast-growing company, there are some improvement points. One of them is the organisation (one still feels a bit lost sometimes, because things are super fast and change fast).And... not exactly a con, but the KPI's are demanding - but totally understandable: if you want to have the best, hire the best and become the best... you gotta set the bar high! Nevertheless, if you come here with the goal of working, learning and enjoying yourself while you do it... everything will work out just fine.Just don't think you will come here to play around just because this is a start-up: you still need to be responsible and do your part! :);1

Jacket and a backpack with a Revolut logo. Enjoy.;If you can and are not completely desperate, then look for a job somewhere else.  Don't get hired by Revolut,  you can hardly find a worse company to work for, with one exception that is Teleperformance Portugal, I guess. You are in a loop of sending automatized messages all day long without actually having any change to truly help a customer as no-one knows what to do and how things really work. Even worse, the performance targets are set up unrealistically that no one can achieve them. A colleague of mine got a panic attack from the overload and stress they put on you. Salary is decent to Portuguese standards but you are not going to know your schedule more than two weeks ahead so say goodbye to any work-life balance as it's non-existent.;12
1.0;Current Employee;A lot needs to change;Dec 21, 2019 - Anonymous Employee;Product is great idea, lots on offer within the office.;Pretty much everything, the whole company is in a mess, with a stream of managers with no experience (most only having internships before leading large scale teams?!?) driving this, they talk about hiring A players yet I would say 90% are C players and would struggle working in any other organisation, the focus has been grow and hire anyone.The Founder Associates drive everything yet they built departments with no knowledge on how to build a business or even the basics in business and finance. We have hired too many non-banking people who have no knowledge of regulations that will impact everything as the company expands. There is no budgeting process in place when recruiting teams, everyone here thinks money is limitless yet money is very limited. The whole organisation needs an overhaul from top to bottom, Nik created a great idea and product yet is now the stopping block for this company being great, he needs to move on to allow the company to succeed further not to mention a bully (I'm surprised no legal, press article has hit about this yet!)If nothing changes in early Q1 2020 this will be a WeWork of the challenger banks, with Martin Gilbert arriving in January he has his work cut out to sort out with the board and in particular his first job (likely from investors being worried) will be to sort out Nik or replace him soon.;7

I was inspired by all the good, bad and ugly available on internet about the company; and overwhelmingly resonated with my work style and desire to work with a company that welcomes innovation, gsd mindset and people's pursuit of doing things better, different, faster etc.  Feels like I have joined a company that truly embraces risk/reward for high performing individuals.  Also seems that all the 'showmanship' leaders/manages with egos, abrasive communication style and selfish mindsets are unwelcome.  And that is a great thing!";No cons as too early.  However I embrace the opportunity to work with the team to build a culture that is fit for the company's Lifestage today, noting high growth period would come with teething problems/personal stress etc.  I welcome the opportunity to showcase how we can be a high performing team in a collegial respectful, continuous learning environment.;1

If you want to work in the company full of arrogant people and never being appreciated on top of super long hours and low pay in comparison to other companies on the market- then go ahead and apply. Just prepare yourself that you will burn out very quickly in the environment like that.  If you need any help with your job, prepare yourself for not getting it but the expectations will always stay the same (!). They will always blame you for something that is out of your control.  If you do your normal hours 9-6 and you leave at 6, people think that you work part-time. The management team only know how to demotivates their stuff. The company could benefit from many changes but they are not willing to listen (and they are getting rid of people who want to change things) thanks to CEO's vision.  It was probably the worst company I was working for and it is a big relief not to be working in such a toxic environment. Fan fact:  if you are not a coder or have strong analytical mind or financial background -  you are not worth anything. Sounds like fun working for such a company?

There are no people whose work doesn’t matter. A support agent that works to help specific people with any queries they may have can either clear up all their questions and worries or ruin their day by being ignorant and invasive. A product owner is here to identify and solve problems that make the most difference for our customers, yet should they fail it will have us make more mistakes on our journey to make people’s lives better.We support each other and are interested in getting to the results we work towards (a) as a team and (b) in a sustainable manner. We have ups and downs together, team rather than individual KPIs, and closely coupled goals across the teams. Everyone in the company is interested in everyone’s else success and has the time to clear out any blockers and answer the questions. The data team I’m part of and can tell most about is very friendly and cheerful) And this is not to mention the high calibre of the people you will be working and interacting with.We take responsibility for what we do and what we build. You become part of a rapidly growing team that is still taking shape and morphing, and, whatever your role is, are on one hell of a ride that is work in a rapidly growing smartly built start-up where decisions are based on data and there is no place for complacency and ignorance.;Taking the responsibility and connecting to what you do will likely mean every now and then going an extra mile. Little matters how much or how little you work, yet it’s intensive and I would not think of life at Revolut as a nine-to-five job. And it’s also your responsibility to avoid burnout and manage your time well.Not everything depends on you. Hardly anything is set in stone, which is mostly good yet at times frustrating, and if what you’ve been working on is no longer relevant to improving what we do and how we do it, it will be let go of. If it’s not the solution and bringing value to what people get with us that matter to you, it may be difficult and might seem somewhat unjust.People that wake up in the morning not knowing what are they doing in this world and need to be told of what’s the meaning of it all (preferably in an invigorating manner) may wilt in a culture of making a difference and getting it done.;3

No common sense. No real employee perks. If you don’t fit in to their ‘culture’ you’ll probably get excluded. Could label this one of the worst companies to work for.;50

You get told the company culture is work 12 hours a day for 7 days which the CEO constantly says in all his interviews. Which is understandable if you are were one of the first employees with lots of stock options to join however to expect someone to 84 hours a week for the same salary as you can make at Google or Facebook, doesn't make sense.Employees get spoken to like crap, the CEO sends out an email threatening employees with being fired if they don't meet their targets every 3-6 months which is always nice to know your CEO doesn't care.We've had 5 different people do the role of Head of People in 18 months, no-one sticks around as the CEO gets rid of them.I'll be leaving as soon as I find a better company and more competent senior management.;122

5.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;Go for it if you connect to what you do);Mar 4, 2019 - Data Scientist;Maybe a somewhat different take on what it feels likeEveryone is important. There are no people whose work doesn’t matter. A support agent that works to help specific people with any queries they may have can either clear up all their questions and worries or ruin their day by being ignorant and invasive. A product owner is here to identify and solve problems that make the most difference for our customers, yet should they fail it will have us make more mistakes on our journey to make people’s lives better.We support each other and are interested in getting to the results we work towards (a) as a team and (b) in a sustainable manner. We have ups and downs together, team rather than individual KPIs, and closely coupled goals across the teams. Everyone in the company is interested in everyone’s else success and has the time to clear out any blockers and answer the questions. The data team I’m part of and can tell most about is very friendly and cheerful) And this is not to mention the high calibre of the people you will be working and interacting with.We take responsibility for what we do and what we build. You become part of a rapidly growing team that is still taking shape and morphing, and, whatever your role is, are on one hell of a ride that is work in a rapidly growing smartly built start-up where decisions are based on data and there is no place for complacency and ignorance.;Taking the responsibility and connecting to what you do will likely mean every now and then going an extra mile. Little matters how much or how little you work, yet it’s intensive and I would not think of life at Revolut as a nine-to-five job. And it’s also your responsibility to avoid burnout and manage your time well.Not everything depends on you. Hardly anything is set in stone, which is mostly good yet at times frustrating, and if what you’ve been working on is no longer relevant to improving what we do and how we do it, it will be let go of. If it’s not the solution and bringing value to what people get with us that matter to you, it may be difficult and might seem somewhat unjust.People that wake up in the morning not knowing what are they doing in this world and need to be told of what’s the meaning of it all (preferably in an invigorating manner) may wilt in a culture of making a difference and getting it done.;3

Good to mention that KPIs are more difficult to meet due to management high expectations so you will be working longer hours than in other startups.- Too many projects going on at the same time and all of them are urgent for management. This situation brings lots of pressure on employees not making days enjoyable at all. - Employee benefits don’t exist;36

5.0;Current Employee, less than 1 year;You need to be passionate;Feb 22, 2018 - Anonymous Employee;- You work in a very energetic and dynamic environment. Things are happening fast here. - Everyone is really passionate about the company. It's not a 9 to 5 kind of job. People love it and are giving everything to drive the changes- You have a real impact and consistently have a feeling of accomplishments. This is different from working in huge corporations.- Direct and honest culture. People raise issues when they see it, are honest to give direct feedback. So things actually move faster here, people are not afraid to speak up.;- Work-Life Balance. Well, no one is making you stay longer. But as you get so enthusiastic about the work, you tend to do that on your own. Also, you're always overwhelmed with the ideas about your job, so you simply don't want to delay it.- Direct Culture. It works great for me, but some other people feel pressure and are not used to that style.;2
